MU Gallery
===

MU Gallery is a WordPress plugin developed by the Office of University Communications for use on the Marshall University website. The plugin is designed to work with the university WordPress theme, [Marsha](www.marshall.edu/marsha/).

# Using the MU Gallery Tool
The MU Gallery tool allows you to add galleries to your webpages that are mobile responsive and optimized for performance. To add a gallery to any Page or Post, follow the instructions below:

1. Click the "Add Media" button above the text box for page content.
2. On the pop-up window, you can select "Create Gallery" from the left menu items
3. Click to select any images you wish to add to the gallery and click the "Create Gallery" button.
4. On the next page, under each image you have the option to add a text caption to the image.
5. Also, on the right you can select the number of images per row. WordPress' default allows 1-9, but the MU Gallery plugin will limit the options from 3-5. So, if you select 1 or 2 it will default to 3. If you select 6-9 it will display as 5 per row.
